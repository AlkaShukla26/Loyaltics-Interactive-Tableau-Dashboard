## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
The **Loyaltics Performance Dashboard** is a Tableau case study focused on analyzing **customer loyalty, transactions, and product performance**.  
It provides a detailed view of how registered and non-registered customers interact with the business, highlighting sales trends, refunds, freebies, and product-level insights.  

The goal of this project was to understand **customer loyalty behaviors** and evaluate their impact on sales and profitability.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- **Overall Metrics**: Displays total sales across registered and non-registered customers.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Yearly and quarterly trends of sales, refunds, and freebies.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Comparison of registered vs non-registered customers.  
- **Product Performance**: Sales contribution by product categories (Shirts, Polo, Knitwear, Trousers, etc.) and by top-selling items.  
- **Refund & Freebie Tracking**: Monitoring refund-heavy transactions and their effect on total revenue.  
- **Dynamic Filters**: Interactivity through parameters (Nationality, App/Non-App, Refund inclusion, Transaction type).

## ðŸ›  Thought Process & Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Raw transactional data was refined to separate registered vs non-registered customers and classify refunds/freebies.  
2. **Calculated Fields**: Created profit margin, net profit margin, and refund-related measures for accurate performance tracking.  
3. **Parameters & Filters**: Built parameters to dynamically switch between App/Non-App users, include/exclude refunds, and segment customer bases.  
4. **Dashboard Design**: Structured in a way that decision-makers can:  
   - Spot **overall business health** at a glance  
   - Deep dive into **product categories** and **loyalty impact**  
   - Monitor **refund losses** and **freebie costs**  
5. **Storytelling with Data**: Visualized quarterly fluctuations, loyalty contribution, and category-wise performance for actionable insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights  
- **Registered customers** contributed slightly higher sales (~20.6M) compared to non-registered (~17.3M).  
- **Refunds & freebies** had a **negative impact**, especially in 2020â€“2021, with losses peaking in Q1 2021.  
- **Shirts & Polo categories** dominated product sales, while items like *polo volume programs* and *plain shirts* stood out at the item level.  
- Loyalty (registration) has a **clear positive effect** on sales, but refund-heavy patterns reduce overall profitability.  
- Business focus should be on **managing refunds** while enhancing loyalty-driven sales.

## âœ… Recommendations  
- Strengthen **loyalty programs** to increase registered customersâ€™ base.  
- Monitor **refund-heavy items** and improve quality checks or return policies.  
- Expand **top-selling categories (Shirts, Polo, Knitwear)** with targeted promotions.  
- Use quarterly monitoring to preempt dips in sales and act on early warning signals.  
- Consider **reducing freebies** or linking them directly to loyalty milestones.
